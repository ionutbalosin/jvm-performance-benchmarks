# Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Performance Microbenchmarks

This repository contains different JVM microbenchmarks for the C2/Graal JIT Compilers and the Garbage Collectors.

Each microbenchmark focuses on a specific execution pattern that is (potentially fully) optimized under ideal conditions (i.e., clean profiles). Such conditions might differ in real-life applications, so the microbenchmarks results are not always a good predictor on a larger scale.

## Purpose

The goal of the project is to assess:

1. different Compiler optimizations by following specific code patterns. At a first glance, even though some of these patterns might rarely appear directly in the user programs, they could occur after a few optimizations (e.g., inlining of high-level operations)
2. different Garbage Collectors' efficiency in both allocating but also reclaiming objects

In this regard, all microbenchmarks are relatively simple but very focused on specific goals.

The microbenchmarks are written using [Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH)](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh) which is an excellent tool for measuring the throughput and sampling latencies end to end.

We left **out of scope**, for now, any specific language feature and larger applications (i.e., macro benchmarking).


## Infrastructure baseline
We provide a baseline benchmark for the infrastructure, [InfrastructureBaselineBenchmark](https://github.com/ionutbalosin/jvm-performance-benchmarks/blob/main/benchmarks/src/main/java/com/ionutbalosin/jvm/performance/benchmarks/InfrastructureBaselineBenchmark.java), that can be used to assess the infrastructure overhead for the code to measure.

It measures the performance of empty methods (w/ and w/o explicit inlining) but also the performance of returning an object versus consuming it via blackholes. All of these mechanisms are used inside the real suite of tests.

This benchmark is particularly useful in case of a comparison between different JVMs and JDKs, and it should be run before any other real benchmark to check the default costs. 
In that regard, if the results of the infrastructure baseline benchmark are not the same, it does not make sense to compare the results of the other benchmarks between different
JVMs and JDKs.

## JMH caveats

### HotSpot-specific compiler hints

> JMH uses HotSpot-specific compiler hints to control the Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler. 

For that reason, at the moment, the fully supported JVMs are all the HotSpot-based VMs, including vanilla OpenJDK and Oracle JDK builds. 
GraalVM is also supported.
For more details please check the [compiler hints](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh/blob/master/jmh-core/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/runner/CompilerHints.java#L37) and [supported VMs](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh/blob/master/jmh-core/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/runner/format/SupportedVMs.java#L31).

### Blackholes

> Using JMH Blackhole.consume() might dominate the costs, obscuring the results, in comparison to a normal Java-style source code.

Starting OpenJDK 17 the compiler supports blackholes [JDK-8259316](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8259316). 
This optimization is available in [HotSpot](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/hotspot/share/opto/library_call.cpp#L7843) and the [Graal compiler](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/compiler/src/org.graalvm.compiler.nodes/src/org/graalvm/compiler/nodes/debug/BlackholeNode.java).

In order to perform a fair comparison between OpenJDK 11 and OpenJDK 17, compiler blackholes should be manually disabled in the microbenchmarks. 

The cost of `Blackhole.consume()` is zero (the compiler will not emit any instructions for the call) when compiler blackholes are enabled and supported by the top-tier JIT compiler of the underlying JVM. 

In case a benchmark annotated method returns a value instead of consuming it via `Blackhole.consume()` 
(e.g., the case of non-void benchmark methods), JMH will wrap the return value of the benchmark 
method in a blackhole, in order to avoid dead code elimination. 
In this case, blackholes are generated by the test infrastructure even though there is no explicit use of them in the benchmarks.  

Manually using `Blackhole.consume()` (e.g in a hot loop) can result in a misleading benchmark result, especially when compiler blackholes are disabled.

For that reason, to focus on broader reusability (i.e., other JDK versions and distributions) and increased test fidelity we recommend (whenever it is possible) avoiding `Blackhole.consume()`.

## Supported JVMs

No. | JVM distribution   | JDK version |  Supported
-------------- |--------------------|-------------| -------------------------------
01 | OpenJDK HotSpot VM | 11, 17      | [Yes](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)
02 | Graal VM CE        | 11, 17      | [Yes](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/)
03 | Graal VM EE        | 11, 17      | [Yes](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/)
04 | Eclipse OpenJ9 VM  | N/A         | No
05 | Azul Prime (Zing)  | N/A         | No

### Support for Eclipse OpenJ9

JMH may functionally work with [Eclipse OpenJ9](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9). However, all the [compiler hints](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh/blob/master/jmh-core/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/annotations/CompilerControl.java) will not apply to Eclipse OpenJ9 and this might lead to different results (i.e., unfair advantage or disadvantage, depending on the test).

For more details please check [JMH with OpenJ9](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/4649) and [Mark Stoodley on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mstoodle/status/1532344345524936704)

At the moment we leave it **out of scope** Eclipse OpenJ9 until we find a proper alternative.

### Support for Azul Prime (Zing)

Publishing benchmark results for Azul Prime (Zing) is prohibited by Azul's Evaluation Agreement. 
It is only allowed to publish results for Azul Prime if prior consent is obtained from Azul.

As of now, we decided to skip this JVM in order to avoid the additional overhead of obtaining such consent.

## Linux: how to get consistent results

When doing benchmarking it is recommended to disable potential sources of performance non-determinism, as follows:
- disable address space randomization
- disable turbo boost
- set `scaling_governor` to `performance`
- disable hyper-threading
- set cpu affinity
- set process priority
- _optionally_, disable Display Power Management system (DPMS)

## Prerequisites

### Install JDK/JVM

To run the benchmarks on different JKD versions / JVMs distributions, please install the corresponding build:

No. | JVM distribution   | JDK version |  Build
-------------- |--------------------|--------------------| -------------------------------
01 | OpenJDK HotSpot VM | 11, 17             | [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)
02 | Graal VM CE        | 11, 17             | [GraalVM CE](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/)

04 | Eclipse OpenJ9 VM  | 11, 17             | [Eclipse OpenJ9](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)

>Note: we support only LTS versions. If there is a need for another JDK feature release, please configure it by yourself.

### Configure JDK/JVM

Open the [configure_jvm.sh](./configure_jvm.sh) script file and update the corresponding **JAVA_HOME** property (as per your system path):
```
export JAVA_HOME="<path_to_jvm>"
```

#### A few examples

Linux OS:
```
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-17.0.2"
```

Mac OS:
```
export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-17.0.2/Contents/Home"
```

Windows OS:
```
export JAVA_HOME="/c/Program_Dev/Java/openjdk-17.0.2"
```

To properly execute bash scripts on Windows there are a few alternatives:
- [GIT bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

## Compile and package the microbenchmarks

### JDK 11

To compile the microbenchmarks using JDK 11 please run the below command:
```
./mvnw -P jdk11_profile clean spotless:apply package
```

### JDK 17

To compile and package the microbenchmarks using JDK 17 please run the below command:
```
./mvnw clean spotless:apply package
```
or (using the default, explicit profile):
```
./mvnw -P jdk17_profile clean spotless:apply package
```

## Run the microbenchmarks (including the entire setup)

### Dry run

This will generate and print all the commands but without executing any real benchmark. 
```
./run-benchmarks.sh --dry-run
```

### Normal run

```
sudo ./run-benchmarks.sh
```

> sudo is needed to properly apply the OS configuration settings.

You can also redirect the output to a file for later analysis:

```
sudo ./run-benchmarks.sh | tee run-benchmarks.out
```
Each JMH test suite result is written to under `results/jdk-$VERSION/$ARCH/$JVM_NAME/$BENCHMARK_NAME$.json`
